Long ago, in the kingdom of AAAAAAAAA people would eat lots of 
weird food and do lots of weird things that should not be listed for totally normal and decent reasons. }}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}


Some people ate slugs, others ate cereal out of a box, and last of all, 
some of them ate rocks like a bunch of totally normal and decent people. 
One day, some person ate a purple thingy, and then his stomach felt funny...

This fool... the name was Akfsl Werasfd III, and it was a terrible morning, a terrible stomach ache, and horrible constipation and then diarrhea followed by *REDACTED* happening. This purple creature shot out and begun to speak.}}

\textit{"Bro, I am your worst nightmare. Everyone is SUSceptible to me in AAAAAAAAA, but you\textbf{ FOOL}, I have INFECTED YOU. You will NEVER ESCAPE ME and neither will everyone you love."}
\hspace{1cm}

\large{{\fontfamily{ptm}\selectfont
The creature started squiggling around and ran out to wreck havoc in the kingdom. A man has fallen into disease in AAAAAAAAA city! Start the new rescue helicopter! HEY! Build the helicopt-
What kind of disease was this? First the people of AAAAAAAAA eat rocks and worms, and now this shows up????? How yucky!

\hspace{1cm}
Suddenly, purple spots started appearing all over Akfsl's face!

"Oh nO, I must do something!!!" he cried.

Suddenly, the \textbf{DOKTER} arrived by crashing through the window!

"DON'T WORRY, WE WILL STOP THIS! I HAVE COME TO SAVE ALL!"

\fontfamily{lmr}\selectfont{
"We MUST act quickly! Time of is of the essence!" declared the \textbf{DOKTER}. "We have to track the worm and how it infects others! EW STAY AWAY FROM ME YOU PURPLE DOTTED MAN!!"

"How ever shall we do that?!" cried Akfsl, scratching the purple spots on his face.

"Everyone in the kingdom of AAAAAAAAA is susceptible to this disease. As soon as they are seen by the worm,"

"slug!"

"by the slug, they become exposed. But if the slug touches them, they become infected"

"But but but... I can't be PURPLE forever! Is there a cure?!"  sobbed Akfsl.

"I AM THE \textbf{DOKTER}, of course there is a cure! Once they sleep for 37 hours, Glenisidf Akjldfkjle 10923091, also known as Purple Pox, will be cured! Off to bed now you weirdo!" 

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{seirlol.png}
The \textbf{DOKTER} has found a way to figure out the next steps and movement of the purple slug. The people of AAAAAAAAA were in danger, but the \textbf{DOKTER} would save the day!
\\

Suspectible for S, Exposed for E, Infected for I, and Recovered for R. The \textbf{DOKTER}'s plan to use the power of the SEIR would surely save AAAAAAAAA!}

The \textbf{DOKTER} traveled far and wide running around, taking samples and notes, licking the concrete, and tracking everywhere the purple slug went. 

Suddenly, an incredibly good looking man with a mustache appeared. \\
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{mokter.png}
\\
"I am the \textit{MOKTER}, and I saw that purple thing!"

"Oh no, you must be exposed!" declared the DOKTER.

"No I am exposed only. The speed of that purple thi-"

"slug!"

"purple slug, has lead to 5 people getting purple dots on their faces!" reported the MOKTER. 

They had to act quick! Purple Pox was spreading very quickly!

"In order to track the purple slug and what it will do next, I created the magical math equations! WITH THE POWER OF MATH, WE WILL CONQUER ALL!"}
\begin{align*}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dS}{dt} = -\phi S I
\end{equation}
The \textit{MOKTER} stated "The first one includes everyone in AAAAAAAAA as they are all at risk for seeing the slug!"
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dE}{dt} = \phi S I - \epsilon Z
\end{equation}
"As everyone becomes exposed by seeing the slug, they are EXPOSED and go here!"
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dI}{dt} = \epsilon Z - I(\zeta + \kappa)
\end{equation}
"Once the slug touches someone, they become infected at a certain rate. Here are the sick lie."
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dR}{dt} = I + \epsilon Z
\end{equation}

"If all goes well, we will fix this!" 
\end{align*}

The \textit{MOKTER} begun frantically, "WE MUST ACT QUICKLY, HURRY!!! Bring the FLAMETHROWER!!!!!" 

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{FLAME.png}

The \textbf{DOKTER} and the \textit{MOKTER} rode into the streets of the kingdom like this. It was time for the final showdown. 
\newpage


\section{\Huge{Chapter 5: THIS IS THE END, HERE's WHERE YOU DIEEEEE, SLUG!}}
\fontfamily{pbk}\selectfont{It was the hour of the final showdown. The \textbf{DOKTER} and the \textit{MOKTER} came hunting for the slug. With the power of their math equations and fancy numbers, they came up with this graph. 

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{geraphh.png}

They knew exactly where the slug was heading:\\THE CASTLE OF AAAAAAAAA!!! 

They ran to the castle, flames shooting everywhere. 
\textit{"Oh noooooo, you found me!"} cried the slug. \textit{"Too bad everyone is infected BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"}
 The \textit{DOKTOR}'s eyes rolled. "You fool, the infected must sleep for several hours, and they will be fine. IT IS YOUR TURN TO PERISH, SLUG!!!!!!!"

 The \textit{MOKTOR} aimed the flames to the slug, and the slug got turned into ashes.
 AAAAAAAAA was rescued from this pandemic, and everyone eventually slept off Purple Pox. 


\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mari.png}
The \textbf{DOKTOR} and the \textit{MOKTER} had such a strong bond that they got married and then had 293489 offspring.}


They all lived happily ever after.

 \Huge{The End.}
